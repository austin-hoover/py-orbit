/** Envelope solver for uniform density elliptical beam.
 
 The method uses the first two particles in the bunch to track the beam envelope, which
 is then used to apply linear space charge kicks to the other particles in the bunch. The
 boundary of a tilted ellipse can be parameterized as
 The boundary of a tilted ellipse in real space can be parameterized as:
     x = a*cos(psi) + b*sin(psi),
     y = e*cos(psi) + f*sin(psi),
 where 0 <= psi <= 2pi.
